Version 3.0 C.H. 12/06/13

- dedicated variable: initialdt
- removed testing files for QED routines
- write routine now sets very small numbers to zero (previously plotting programs had problems with numbers 1e-100 and smaller
- multiple laser beams added
	- note that further modifications needed if you want a circularly polarised beam
- initial y0 added to code
- classical chi calculation module added
	- means changes to the t/ct/... flag in the particle_input.txt file


Version 2.3 C.H. 03/03/13

- trajectories.dat file changed from unit=1 to unit=41
- initial conditions of particle are now read in from a 'particle_input.csv' file
	The first line is a headerline.
	The second line contains one integer: the number of runs.  This must be .le. to 
	the number of subsequent lines in the file.
	The subsequent lines are structured as follows:
	particle_no, charge_sign, e_charge, me, theta_i, dist0, x0, y0, z0, gama0, t/s/x
		- particle_no is not used by the code, but it is suggested to be used to number the particles
		- charge_sign=-1 for electrons or +1 for positrons
		- e_charge= abs(particle charge) in natural units
		- me= particle mass in natural units
		- theta_i=angle of particle's initial velocity w.r.t z axis (degrees)
		- dist0= initial distance from the coordinate (x0,0,z0) (i.e. the origin if x0=z0=0) (metres)
		- x0,z0: the particle is initially aimed at (x0,0,z0)
		- y0 ***reserved for future use!***
		- gama0= initial g-factor
		- write_data flag:  	't'=write trajectory to file
					's'=write trajectory to file and calculate classical spectra
					'x'= don't write to file
		if this quantity is set to 't' or 's' then a 'trajectoryXXXX.dat' file will be created.
	The code currently allows up to 9999 particles.
- the 'inputparameters' module no longer exists
- there is now a 'particlevariables' module which defines the data types of variables in the particle_input.csv file.

- the laser field intensities can be recorded to file by setting record_intensity_y0=1 in the 
'simulationparameters' module.
- the classical spectra for particle XXXX will be output to 'spectraXXXX.dat' if the write_data flag is set to 's'.  
***This is currently buggy and should not be used!***.

- the beam_angle can be altered, but this is also buggy unless =0 or 180.  I hope to fix this soon!
