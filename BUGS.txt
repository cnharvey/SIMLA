tshift needs correcting to the paper's Gaussian beam case: this is right I think

Constant fields needs frequency normalisation set to 1

Two beams with different frequencies: problem

The Matlab files can't cope with multiple runs from the same line

Check beam waist units, w0

Check ALL durations for pulse profiles
